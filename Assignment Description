In this code, we create a WalkingReminder class with a nested WalkingReminderTask class that extends TimerTask. 
The WalkingReminderTask defines the task to be executed at regular intervals.
It checks the current time and compares it with the start and end times specified (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM).
If the current time is within this range, it displays a reminder message to take a walk.
To customize the program further, we can modify the values of START_TIME and END_TIME to suit Sunita's preferred walking hours.
